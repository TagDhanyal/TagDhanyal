# Hey there! üëã

I'm Dhanyal Tag, a 17-year-old Solution Architect and software engineer on a mission to craft exceptional tech solutions. Here's a quick dive into what I specialize in:

## Solution Architecture
I design cloud software solutions focused on delivering the best user experience. From seamless data engineering and data science integration to AI engineering, backend development, and robust DevOps practices, I ensure every element is meticulously crafted.

## Generative AI
My passion lies in Generative AI, where I bring creativity and innovation to the forefront. From AI chatbots to generative AI engineering, I'm committed to making tech not just functional but also captivating.

## DevOps & Infrastructure
Seamlessly integrating DevOps practices, I navigate AWS (most services) & Azure (AKS, OpenAI, Azure Pipelines etc) and more to ensure smooth operations and efficient infrastructure. Automation is the key to driving excellence in every project.

## Cloud Solutions
AWS is my playground, but I also explore Azure and GCP proficiently. Whether it's OpenAI in Azure, AKS, GKE, Firebase, or more, I architect cloud solutions that align with real-world needs.

## Security-First Mindset
Security is ingrained in every solution I craft.
ned in every solution I craft. It's not just about protecting data; it's about securing the entire user experience.
