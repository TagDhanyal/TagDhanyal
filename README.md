As a highly motivated and ambitious aspiring Cloud Engineer, I have gained extensive experience in AWS and Terraform, earning 6 AWS certifications and becoming a Terraform Associate. Additionally, I am a Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) and am dedicated to continuously expanding my skill set in the cloud computing field.

At the age of 16, I am passionate about technology and am committed to pursuing a career in Cloud Engineering. With a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python and experience working with cloud technologies, I am confident in my ability to excel in this field.
